# 06 — Release Notes

[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)-style, anchored on tags.
`v0.0.1` is the first tag this repo has — everything before it is
reconstructed from `git log` and grouped into the same phases as §10 of
`DOCUMENTATION.md`, without version numbers of its own (it was never
tagged at the time).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-24

Presentation & correctness polish — small, high-leverage fixes to make
what `v0.0.1` already did legible, not new features.

**Added:**
- "Proof It Works" section in `README.md` — a real, live-captured
  conversation transcript (greeting → knowledge → pronoun follow-up
  testing session-scoped memory/query rewriting → guardrail rejection),
  not hand-written or fabricated.

**Fixed:**
- `RAGState` declared `retrieved_documents`/`reranked_documents`, but
  `retrieve_context.py` had always written to an undeclared `documents`
  key instead. Renamed the declared field to `documents` to match
  reality; `reranked_documents` will come back for real once reranking
  (v0.2.0) exists. See `07-design-decisions.md`.
- Removed the unused `openai` dependency from `requirements.txt`
  (confirmed unreferenced anywhere in `src/`; Groq via `langchain-groq`
  is the actual LLM provider).

## [0.0.1] — 2026-07-24

First tagged version — a direct answer to "is this prod-level yet" (no)
turned into a full stabilization pass. Commits `cd018dc` through the tag,
on top of `aa19c6c` below.

**Fixed:**
- The stale-index problem, for real, not just cosmetically. Rebuilt the
  FAISS index with the current `ingestion_fixed` pipeline rather than
  repointing at the newer-looking `vectorstore/` build, which turned out
  to have the exact pre-fix chunking/metadata bugs `ingestion_fixed`
  exists to fix (confirmed by direct `index.pkl` inspection: avg 64-char
  chunks, `document_type: 'pdf'` everywhere). Old index directories
  renamed aside for comparison, then deleted once verified. Full story in
  §8 of `DOCUMENTATION.md`. (`cd018dc`)
- Per-session conversation memory — `RAGResources` no longer holds
  `memory`; it's keyed by `session_id` in `RAGService` and carried through
  `RAGState["session_memory"]` per request. Uncovered a much bigger bug in
  the process: `chat_history` was hardcoded to `""` on every call and
  never actually populated from memory — conversation context had **zero
  effect** on behavior before this fix, in any session configuration.
  `src/utils/chat_history.py::format_chat_history` existed but was never
  called from the live workflow. Verified fixed end-to-end. (`0eeae75`)
- A `StateGraph` node/state-key collision (`"intent"` used as both a node
  id and a state field) that made the graph fail to even *build* under
  the `langgraph` version actually installed here — first time this
  workflow had run end-to-end in this dev environment. (`0eeae75`)
- A whitespace-based prompt-injection detection bypass: extra internal
  spaces in a blocked phrase (`"ignore   previous   instructions"`) evaded
  every pattern, since `PromptInjectionValidator` ran before
  `QueryNormalizer` in the chain. Fixed by matching a whitespace-collapsed
  copy internally, without reordering the chain. (`86aeb21`)

**Added:**
- Standalone FastAPI service (`src/api.py`): `GET /health`, `POST /query`
  (with `session_id`), `POST /reload` (in-place FAISS reload, no restart),
  `POST /reset-memory` — all but `/health` behind `X-API-Key` auth
  (`RAG_API_KEY`). Deployable alongside `ingestion_fixed`'s own API over a
  shared FAISS volume (`docker-compose.yml`). (`1e482e4`)
- `Dockerfile` (none existed before). (`1e482e4`)
- Full pytest suite: 57 tests — all 5 guardrail validators, the chain's
  ordering/short-circuit behavior, and all 7 workflow nodes, with fake
  LLM/retriever (`tests/conftest.py`) and no real network calls.
  (`79b40bd`)
- Full documentation set: `DOCUMENTATION.md` + numbered `docs/`.
  (`42d4200`)

**Changed:**
- `src/retrieval/config.py`'s `FAISS_PATH` reads `FAISS_INDEX_PATH` env
  var instead of being hardcoded. (`cd018dc`)
- `src/retrieval/llm.py`'s `LLMFactory` accepts `GROQ_API_KEY` from the
  environment directly, without requiring `cred.json`. (`1e482e4`)
- `requirements.txt` — `langgraph` pinned to `0.2.76` (previously
  unpinned/missing entirely; `>=0.3` conflicts with this project's
  `langchain-core` pin); `fastapi`/`uvicorn` corrected to the versions
  actually verified working (`0.139.2`/`0.51.0`). (`1e482e4`)

## `aa19c6c` (2026-07-24) — Remove in-tree ingestion pipeline

Committed the `src/ingestion/` deletion (16 files) and
`test/cuda_test.py`/`test/exp_notebook.ipynb` that had sat uncommitted for a
while — see `04-contributing.md`'s Git hygiene section for why that was a
problem in its own right. `git log` and the working tree now agree that
this repo has no ingestion code.

## 2026-07-16 — New ingestion pipeline (later removed from this repo)

- `5e12446` (HEAD as of last commit) — Added a full modular ingestion
  package under `src/ingestion/` (loaders, cleaners, chunkers, embedders,
  indexers, metadata) plus validation/benchmark scripts, and landed query
  rewriting (`src/processing/query_rewriter.py`,
  `src/workflow/nodes/process_query.py`) in the same commit. This ingestion
  code was later removed from the working tree (see Unreleased, above) and
  spun off into the standalone `ingestion_fixed` project — see §8 of
  `DOCUMENTATION.md` for the full history.

## 2026-07-15 — Guardrails + full modular LangGraph workflow (Phase 1 complete)

- `bd797f6` — README updated to mark Phase 1 (production RAG workflow)
  complete. Natural tag point that was never tagged.
- `dbcc9fd` — **feat:** modular LangGraph workflow with input guardrails —
  the node/routing architecture described in `01-architecture.md`, largely
  as it exists today.
- `27e969e` — Refactored factories, debugging improvements, CUDA support
  for the embedding model.

## 2026-07-14 — LangGraph hardening, testing, observability

- `b642bde` — Fixed intent node for greeting/chit-chat routing.
- `a65328c` — Logger function updated.
- `422151c` — Codebase cleanup.
- `1e5ed5d` — Added a test runner for unit testing and reporting (the
  ancestor of today's `src/evaluation/runner.py`).
- `c04f0c7` — Workflow updated for "LangGraph phase-1" (commit message has
  a typo — see `04-contributing.md`'s Git hygiene section).
- `34c4714` — `requirements.txt` updated alongside nodes/graph directory
  restructuring.

## 2026-07-08 — LangGraph foundation

- `46137e0` — Merge remote changes.
- `9719177` — Added LangGraph foundation: shared `RAGState` and
  `RAGResources` container — the point where this stopped being a single
  `RAGPipeline` class (`rag_pipeline_archived.py` — dead code by this point;
  removed entirely in the 2026-07-24 cleanup pass, recoverable via git
  history if ever needed) and became a graph of nodes.

## 2026-05-07 — Ingestion/retrieval split, iterative hardening (pre-LangGraph era)

- `cb1b1ee`, `5cd05ef`, `4ab18d5`, `74bd882`, `97bcde1`, `644b461`,
  `081367a` — reference fixes, `main.py` fixes, removing a redundant LLM
  call in intent classification, JSON-structured response format.
- `73c59e0` — "seperated the ingestion and retiveal pipelines" — flat `src/`
  reorganized into `src/ingestion/` (a placeholder, committed fully
  commented out — see `04-contributing.md`'s Git hygiene section) and
  `src/retrieval/` (the working LangChain pieces, still the retrieval
  layer's structure today).
- `0851534` — Resolved a `.gitignore` merge conflict.
- `552be68`, `eea561b` — README revisions, removed promotional content.
- `9b117d5` — `.gitignore` updated to ignore `cred.json` (before any secret
  had a chance to leak).
- `e5eef3f` — `venv_rag` ignored.
- `69f534a` — Initial commit.

## Documented but not in this repo's git history

The pre-`73c59e0` "monolithic script era" (a single flat `src/` with
`ingestion_pipeline.py` and `rag_pipeline.py`) isn't reconstructable from
`git log` — it predates or was squashed into the initial commit. It used to
be described in `local/project_history/README_v3.md`, an untracked local
file that was permanently deleted in a 2026-07-24 cleanup pass (not
git-recoverable — it was gitignored, never committed). What's written about
that era in `DOCUMENTATION.md` §1/§8 is a paraphrase from a reading of that
file earlier the same session, not a verbatim record.
