# Intelligent Document AI

> A production-ready **Document Intelligence System** built with **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **FAISS** for intelligent document understanding, contextual retrieval, and conversational AI.

---

# Overview

Intelligent Document AI is designed to move beyond traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by introducing an intelligent workflow layer capable of understanding user intent, validating requests, routing conversations, and retrieving the most relevant document context before generating responses.

The project follows a modular architecture where every stage of the workflow is isolated into reusable components, making it easy to extend, maintain, and scale.

Current implementation focuses on:

* Production-ready LangGraph workflow
* Modular node architecture
* Input Guardrails
* Intent Detection
* Conversational AI
* Contextual Retrieval
* Evaluation Framework
* Structured Logging
* GPU Accelerated Embeddings

The long-term goal is to evolve this project into a complete enterprise-grade Document Intelligence Platform.

# Documentation

This README covers the feature list and roadmap. For the technical detail:

- [`DOCUMENTATION.md`](DOCUMENTATION.md) — full architecture and
  module-by-module reference, including the history of the ingestion
  pipeline that used to live in this repo.
- [`docs/`](docs/) — deeper-dive docs: [architecture](docs/01-architecture.md),
  [RAG best practices](docs/02-rag-best-practices.md),
  [development guide](docs/03-development-guide.md),
  [contributing](docs/04-contributing.md), [roadmap](docs/05-roadmap.md),
  [release notes](docs/06-release-notes.md),
  [design decisions](docs/07-design-decisions.md).

This project pairs with a separate ingestion project
(`ingestion_fixed`, a sibling repo) that builds the FAISS index this
project reads from — see `docs/01-architecture.md` for how the two
connect, and `DOCUMENTATION.md` §8 for why ingestion no longer lives here.

**Status:** this repo is still pre-MVP and under active development —
unlike `ingestion_fixed`, which is considered stable. See `docs/05-roadmap.md`
for the concrete, current gap list.

# Workflow Nodes

### Input Guardrail

Validates every incoming request before it enters the system.

Validators include:

* Empty Query Validation
* Length Validation
* Prompt Injection Detection
* Character Validation
* Query Normalization

---

### Intent Detection

Classifies the request into:

* Knowledge
* Greeting
* Chit Chat

This determines the execution path inside LangGraph.

---

### Retrieve Context

Responsible for

* Embedding Query
* FAISS Similarity Search
* Context Construction

---

### Generate Knowledge

Generates grounded answers using retrieved document context.

---

### Generate Conversation

Handles greetings and general conversational responses without document retrieval.

---

### Update Memory

Maintains conversation history for contextual interactions.

---

# Evaluation Framework

The project includes a custom evaluation framework capable of testing the complete workflow.

Current evaluation categories include:

* Knowledge Questions
* Greetings
* Chit Chat
* Out-of-Context Queries
* Empty Queries
* Whitespace Queries
* Prompt Injection
* Long Queries
* Query Normalization
* Rewrite Tests

Each evaluation records:

* Response
* Intent
* Latency
* Success Status
* Metadata

Results are automatically exported as CSV reports.

---

# Input Guardrails

Current Guardrails include:

* Empty Query Validator
* Length Validator
* Prompt Injection Validator
* Character Validator
* Query Normalizer

Future Guardrails:

* PII Detection
* Toxicity Detection

* Role Validation

---

# Logging

Every workflow node provides structured logs including:

* Node Start
* Node Completion
* Execution Time
* Retrieval Statistics
* Intent Detection
* Context Length
* Guardrail Results

This significantly improves debugging and production observability.

---

# GPU Support

The embedding model automatically detects the available hardware.

Priority:

```text

# Running the Project

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/yugmint/query_intellience_llm.git"

cd Intelligent-Document-AI
```

---

## Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

---

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configure Credentials

Create a `cred.json` file:

```json
{
    "grok_api_key": "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
}
```

---

## Run Application

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Run as a Standalone API

For deployment alongside `ingestion_fixed`'s own API, sharing one FAISS
index via a mounted volume (see the top-level `docker-compose.yml`, one
directory up):

```bash
RAG_API_KEY=your-shared-secret uvicorn src.api:app --reload --port 8001
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-API-Key: your-shared-secret" \
     -d '{"query": "your question here", "session_id": "optional-per-user-id"}'
```

`RAG_API_KEY` is optional for local dev (omit it and the API runs
unauthenticated with a warning) but required before exposing this beyond
localhost. `session_id` is optional too — omit it to use one shared
conversation, or pass a distinct id per user/session to keep conversations
isolated.

See `docs/01-architecture.md` and `DOCUMENTATION.md` §12 for details,
including the `/reload` endpoint and a known bootstrap-order gotcha.

---

## Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Currently covers the guardrail validator chain; see `docs/03-development-guide.md`.

## Run Evaluation

```bash
python -m src.evaluation.runner
```

Evaluation reports will be generated under:

```text
src/evaluation/results/
```

# Design Philosophy

The architecture follows a modular design where each component has a single responsibility.

* Guardrails validate requests.
* Workflow nodes orchestrate execution.
* Retrieval components manage document search.
* Services coordinate application logic.
* Evaluation continuously validates system performance.

This separation of concerns enables maintainability, extensibility, and production scalability.
